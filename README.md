Maratis Tiny C library
======================

is a collection of small and efficient math and image processing routines written in ANSI C with no dependencies.

The library is divided in independent single files (stb style):
- [m_math.h](https://github.com/anael-seghezzi/Maratis-Tiny-C-library/blob/master/include/m_math.h)
- [m_image.h](https://github.com/anael-seghezzi/Maratis-Tiny-C-library/blob/master/include/m_image.h)
- [m_raster.h](https://github.com/anael-seghezzi/Maratis-Tiny-C-library/blob/master/include/m_raster.h)
- [m_dist.h](https://github.com/anael-seghezzi/Maratis-Tiny-C-library/blob/master/include/m_dist.h)
- [m_path_finding.h](https://github.com/anael-seghezzi/Maratis-Tiny-C-library/blob/master/include/m_path_finding.h)

Math
----

* vector manipulation
* interpolation (cubic, catmullrom)
* quaternion (basics, slerp...)
* matrix (projection, transformation...)
* random number generator
* 2d routines
* 3d routines
  * voxeliser (tri-box overlap)
  * raytracing (sphere, plane, box, triangle)

Image manipulation
------------------

* ubyte, ushort, int, half, float...
* copy, conversions, mirror, reframe, rotate...
* filters (convolution, gaussian blur, sobel, harris)
* resizing, pyrdown
* morphology (floodfill, dilate, erode, thinning...)
* corner detection (harris, non-maxima suppression)

Rasterization
-------------

* triangle with interpolation (perspective correct)
* basic line, circle and polygon

Distance map
------------

* distance transform and voronoi

Path finding
------------

* path finding on regular grid (floodfill-based)
